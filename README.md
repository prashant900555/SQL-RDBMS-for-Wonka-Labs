# SQL-RDBMS-for-Wonka-Labs

<p align="justify"> This project report envisions the practical implementation of the whitepaper which was leaked from the laboratories of the notoriously secretive William P. Wonka III, grandson of that most famed Wonka of all, the founder of Wonka industries and the creator of the world’s most delectable candies. Wonka has suffered miserable amount of reputational damage, in spite of which, his grandson is about to recast the Wonka brand by amplifying its reach into the food ventures. These ventures extraordinarily encompass the savory baked goods and adult beverages. We will see what these are in the later sections. There are multiple teams handling the various kinds of strands which the Wonka innovation pipeline has defined. The teams include, various scientists, marketing analysts, data analysts, and many more. I have been appointed as a DBA (Database Administrator), wherein I’m responsible for creating the RDBMS bedrock in order to brace the strands offered by the Wonka Laboratories.  </p>
  
  <p align="justify"> After reading the 6-page white paper, I realized I have a lot of constraints, definitions, normalizations, procedural elements, and what not… to take care off; for which I thought about using MySQL Workbench to initiate the design of the Wonka Labs database schema consisting multiple strands. While designing the schema, the most important thing which I kept in mind was interpretability of the SQL queries, defined tables, views, procedural elements, etc. Even though the notion of my database schema might seem gigantic, I have conspicuously taken the data normalization process very whole-heartedly, because of which there are a lot of tables; but they are evident proof of how efficient, and easy-query processing the entities of the database are.  </p>
